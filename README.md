# Telecom Churn Detection Using LSTM

This repository contains a project for detecting customer churn in the telecom industry using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The project includes a web interface built with Flask to interact with the churn detection model.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict customer churn using LSTM, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed for sequential data. Churn detection helps telecom companies identify customers who are likely to leave, allowing them to take proactive measures. The project features a Flask-based web interface for easy interaction with the model.

## Features

- **Customer Churn Detection:** Predicts the likelihood of customer churn using an LSTM model.
- **Web Interface:** Provides a Flask-based application for interacting with the model.
- **Model Training and Evaluation:** Includes scripts for training and evaluating the LSTM model.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Programming language used for development.
- **TensorFlow:** Framework used for building and training the LSTM model.
- **Flask:** Web framework used for creating the web interface.
- **Pandas:** Data manipulation library for data processing.
- **NumPy:** Library for numerical operations.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/telecom-churn-detection.git
   cd telecom-churn-detection
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare the Data:**
   - Ensure your dataset is in the `data/` directory. The dataset should be in a format compatible with the training scripts.

2. **Train the Model:**

   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

   This script will train the LSTM model using the provided dataset.

3. **Run the Flask Application:**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   This command starts the Flask web server. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the web interface.

4. **Make Predictions:**
   - Use the web interface to upload customer data and obtain churn predictions from the model.

## Deployment

To deploy the Flask application on a local server or your preferred hosting platform, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure Flask Application is Running:**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   The application will be accessible via `http://localhost:5000`.

2. **Configure for Production (Optional):**
   - For production deployment, consider using a production-ready server like Gunicorn or uWSGI.

3. **Server Configuration:**
   - Configure the server to host the Flask application and make it accessible over the internet, if required.

## Results

The LSTM model provides predictions on customer churn, helping to identify at-risk customers. Detailed performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, are available in the `results/` directory.
